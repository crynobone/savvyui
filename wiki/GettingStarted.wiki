If this is your first time using Savvy.UI and you feel a bit lost let me guide you on how to start developing application using Savvy.UI using narrative documentation.

===Downloading===
At the moment, Savvy.UI package is available in (.ZIP) format from [http://code.google.com/p/savvyui/downloads/list our download page]. Unlike other available JavaScript alternative, we provide both compressed and uncompressed script in a single package so you can use the same package for development as well as production.

===Revision===
Savvy.UI Team will update the Savvy.UI from time to time with new feature and bugfix based on current release which is available through our GoogleCode SVN Server. Check out our latest code from http://code.google.com/p/savvyui/source/checkout
