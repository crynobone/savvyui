===Downloading===
At the moment, Savvy.UI package is available in (.ZIP) format. Unlike other available JavaScript alternative, we provide both compressed and uncompressed script in a single package so you can use the same package for development as well as production. In case you need to compressed the code, Savvy.UI Team recommend JavaScript Compressor.

Savvy.UI Team will update the Savvy.UI from time to time with new feature and bugfix based on current release. At the moment, we can only afford to maintain one build version at each point of time.
